Luchess
=========

Luchess is a free, open-source, Java-based web application, which lets you search for chess games, by their opening moves. It is based on the popular [Apache Lucene] library - hence its cheeky name!

If you want to get started with Luchess, check out the [User Manual]. If you want to understand how it works, read the [Developer Manual].

I hope that you will enjoy the program in your daily chess life.
